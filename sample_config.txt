# Process Scheduling Simulator - Sample Configuration File
# =========================================================
#
# This file defines the processes for the scheduling simulation.
#
# Format: process_name arrival_time burst_time priority [quantum]
#
# Fields:
#   process_name  - Unique identifier for the process
#   arrival_time  - Time when the process arrives (integer >= 0)
#   burst_time    - Total CPU time required (integer > 0)
#   priority      - Process priority (lower number = higher priority)
#   quantum       - Optional: time quantum for round-robin (integer > 0)
#
# Notes:
#   - Lines starting with # or ; are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Fields are separated by spaces or tabs

# Example process set demonstrating various scheduling scenarios

# High priority, arrives first
P1 0 10 1

# Medium priority, arrives shortly after
P2 2 5 2

# Low priority, arrives later
P3 4 8 3

# High priority, arrives late (will preempt in priority scheduling)
P4 6 3 1

# Very low priority, long burst
P5 8 12 4
